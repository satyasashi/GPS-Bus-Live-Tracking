# GPS-Transport-locator

The basic Idea is to let users know Where the Public transport Buses are and how far they are from their location. Initially the thought was to put GPS tracker for every bus, but after talking to #Nivesh and talked about his idea as well, he seems to be right. So, the bus driver will be having his mobile and details 

1. About the bus he is driving.
2. Where does it go all the day etc..

People who are looking for a Bus, these information will be sent to them and based on the User's distance from the Bus, for some radius, when Bus is near to him, he will be getting notified about it and the estimation time for him to travel to the Bus Bay.

I just have the idea and didn't figure out what technologies can be used for best results. But, I was thinking to make a Web App, instead of Android, where people with any mobile OS can access it using browsers.
